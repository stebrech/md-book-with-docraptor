## Markdown Files

Add your markdown files within the `src` folder. The name of the files are not used in the output but need to be named to represent the correct order. Therefore you could name the files `chapter01.md`, `chapter02.md` and so on.

### Headings

The book title uses a heading 1 and the subtitle a paragraph tag. Each markdown file will be put in a section tag. For semantic reasons and because of the default styles you should begin each markdown file with a heading 2 and use it only once for each chapter.

### Manual page break

The horizontal rule element (`<hr>`; markdown syntax `***`) is “misused” to create a manual page or column break. It is set to not visible either for screen and print.
